This site is built with **React** and **Vite**, deployed on **Vercel**.

I wanted a place to showcase my projects, write about what I'm learning, and make it easy to contact me.

In this post, I talk about the project structure, why I chose Vite over Create React App, and a few things I'd like to add next.

I'm approaching AWS as a software developer with a Security+ mindset.

In this post, I summarize my mental model of AWS and where I'm focusing first.
